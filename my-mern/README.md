# My mern to-do list application
- This is a basic time based to-do list application I am working on my own to learn mern
- It is an that holds multiple users 
- The user can input how long they have to complete the task 
- The app is NOT meant for any application and simply a project done overtime to build up my skill with mern 
- The overall goal and aspects of the project are subject to change as learning mern is the most important aspect of the project 

# How I am building it 
- with the mern stack
